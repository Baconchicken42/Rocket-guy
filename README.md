# Rocket-guy
extremely basic demo of a game concept where the main mode of attack is rocketing towards enemies. Hold space and a direction to rocket forward!

NEW STUFF 7/18/2021:
--Added enemy that moves back and forth and kills the player (can be seen in EnemyTest scene)
--allowed the player to kill enemies

--fixed issues with the tilemap collider for the floor
--found workaround for sprite renderer on player character not flipping the x axis

//TODO:
--design a few levels for final submission
--maybe add some environmental mechanics
